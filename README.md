# 🏎️ BMW Sales Data Analysis & Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the full **data analysis lifecycle** using a BMW sales dataset.  
It covers:

1. **Data Cleaning** – handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – creating new variables for deeper insights.  
4. **Hypothesis Testing** – applying statistical methods (Scipy, Statsmodels).  
5. **Pipeline Automation (Optional)** – orchestrating the workflow using Prefect / Airflow.  

This project is designed for my **data analyst + machine learning portfolio** and highlights both **analytical thinking** and **technical implementation**.
